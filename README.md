# AirlineHubsQuantumOptimization

This project aims to optimize the airline's operating costs by strategically selecting specific airports as hubs to 
minimize costs. These hubs serve as transfer points that connect flights and transport passengers to their destinations 
without establishing a dedicated flight between each possible pair of airports. The task is to optimize the 
interconnections between airports, ensuring passengers can travel from any airport to any other while minimizing the 
overall network costs. By reducing the costs of flights between airport hubs, there can be benefits from larger aircraft 
becoming profitable as demand increases. Despite the increase in demand passing through these connections, there is a 
limit to the number of hubs we can have.

The original problem was presented in:
