# AirlineHubsQuantumOptimization

This project aims to optimize the airline's operating costs by strategically selecting specific airports as hubs to 
minimize costs.

The original problem was presented in:  
[O'Kelly, Morton. (1987). A Quadratic Integer Program for the Location of Interacting Hub Facilities.

The derivation of the formulas needed to formulate the discrete quadratic model was based on the tutorial:
